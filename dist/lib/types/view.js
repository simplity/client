/**
 * All the view components that are used to render the app-design components
 *
 * NOTE: There will be cross-references between view components and controllers.
 * e.g. a FieldView will have a reference to its FormController, and the FormController will have references to all its FieldViews
 * This is OK as long as we do not try to serialize these objects.
 * Controllers are in src/lib/controller and view components are in src/lib/view
 * The app-specific implementations of these interfaces are in app/client/src/viewComponents and app/client/src/controllers respectively
